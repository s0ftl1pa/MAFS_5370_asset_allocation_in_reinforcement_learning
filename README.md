# MAFS_5370_asset_allocation_in_reinforcement_learning

In this project, we focus on sovling the Asset Allocation Problem via TD algorithm. In total, there are five files included.

* `A1_asset_allocation.py`: The script to perform asset allocation process.
* `report.pdf`: The report that contains the code explanation, several contrast experiment and the result analysis of our project.
* `Mathematical Analysis of Asset Allocation Problem.pdf`: Mathematical derivation of optimal policy and action-value function.
* `aa_unittest.py`: A unittest script to test the correctness of several important methods in the class Framework.
* `A1_asset_allocation.ipynb`: The notebook of the report.
